## [Unreleased]
### Documentation
- Documented availability of production-grade runtime features (connectors, triggers, observability, security, CLI extensions, worker queue engine).
- Updated GenXBot docs to reflect full recipe-template integration: `recipe_id`/`recipe_inputs` rendering, blending recipe + agent-generated actions, deduplication, and fallback action guarantees.
- Added implementation/test references for recipe blending behavior in GenXBot docs (`orchestrator.py`, `routes_runs.py`, and orchestrator blend tests).
- Expanded GenXBot observability docs with structured hooks for plan latency, tool execution attempts, safety decisions, and retry/failure events.
- Added usage/setup examples for recipe-templated runs and observability verification endpoints.
