# GenXAI (Non‑Studio) Competitive Matrix

This document compares **GenXAI (core framework, excluding Studio UI)** against
popular agentic frameworks and workflow engines: **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, **BeeAI**,
**AutoGPT**, **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, and **n8n**.

> Scope note: Studio‑specific GUI features are intentionally excluded from this comparison.

---

## Executive Summary

GenXAI’s **core runtime** is feature‑complete for agent workflows, tool orchestration,
multi‑provider LLM support, and **workflow triggers/connectors**. It competes well with
**CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, **LangChain**, and **LlamaIndex** on developer‑centric orchestration,
but still trails **n8n** on breadth of plug‑and‑play integrations and GUI‑first automation UX.
Compared to **BeeAI** and **AutoGPT**, GenXAI offers stronger graph orchestration,
production‑grade observability/security, and broader built‑in runtime controls.

Key gaps to reach parity across the board:

- Broader **connector ecosystem** (SaaS + business systems)
- Rich **plugin marketplace** and community template packs
- Expanded **integration test matrix** for memory/vector store backends

Weighted score formula: **(score / 5) × weight**

**Normalization Notes**
- Scores are normalized to a **0–100** scale by multiplying each dimension’s 1–5 rating
  by its weight fraction (weight/100) and summing across dimensions.
- Weights are fixed per scenario and sum to **100**.
- A score of **100** represents a theoretical best‑in‑class solution scoring **5** on
  every dimension for the chosen weights.

## Readiness Verdict (Non‑Studio)

**Competitive with CrewAI/AutoGen on core orchestration and tooling.**
GenXAI now includes **core triggers/connectors** and a **worker queue engine**.
To compete with **n8n** and broader automation platforms, GenXAI needs broader
connector coverage, richer templates, and ecosystem growth.

## Recommended Next Milestones

1. **Connector Ecosystem Expansion** (top SaaS + business systems)
2. **Expanded Vector Store Coverage** + integration tests
3. **Template Marketplace** (discoverable workflow packs)
4. **Deployment Hardening** (K8s/Helm, secrets policy, CI benchmarks)
