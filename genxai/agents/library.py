"""Curated library of reusable role agents.

Battle-tested agent definitions — tuned role, goal, backstory, temperature,
agent type, and default tools — for the roles most workflows need. Use them
three ways:

- Python: ``from genxai.agents import researcher; agent = researcher(tools=["web_scraper"])``
- YAML: ``export_library_yaml(path)`` writes an ``agents_ref``-compatible
  file for no-code workflow definitions
- Generation: ``render_library_for_prompt()`` feeds the definitions to the
  crew's agent designer as quality exemplars

Every factory accepts overrides, so the library is a starting point, not a
cage: ``researcher(id="market_researcher", goal="Research fintech rivals")``.

Default tools reference built-in tool names; they apply when those tools are
registered in the runtime's ToolRegistry and are otherwise inert.
