"""The planner: natural-language request → validated WorkflowPlan.

Phase 1 baseline of the generation crew. The planner calls the LLM through
``generate_structured`` (schema-enforced, with repair retries) and then
grounds the plan against the capability catalog: any capability the catalog
does not contain triggers a bounded re-plan with the offending names named
explicitly.

Guidelines:
- Step ids are snake_case and unique; 'start' and 'end' are reserved.
- Prefer the fewest steps that satisfy the request; every step must earn its place.
- kind='agent' steps do LLM reasoning; list any catalog tools they need in capabilities.
- kind='tool' (or 'connector'/'mcp') steps invoke exactly ONE capability mechanically.
- kind='decision' steps branch: set condition, and give each dependent step a
  'when' expression describing its branch.
- kind='loop' steps repeat: set condition, optionally params.max_iterations.
- kind='flow' steps embed an agent team: set flow_pattern to a catalog flow
  capability and give team at least 2 members (role + goal each).
- depends_on expresses data/order dependencies; independent steps with the
  same dependency run in parallel automatically.
- trigger.kind is 'manual' unless the request implies a webhook or schedule."""
